The figure is the boost-coverter circuit.<br> 
Components: <br> 
(i) MOSFET <br>
(ii) Inductor <br>
(iii) Capacitor <br>
(iv) Diode <br>
(v) 555 timer <br>
First built the inductor (160mH) using  toroidal core and magnetic wire. <br> 
Second, built the boost-converter and analyze it by varying the duty cyle using function generator and then substituing the function generator by 555-timer. 555-timer is acting as function generator to vary the duty cyle of the circuit. <br>
